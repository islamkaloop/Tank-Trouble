# Tank-Trouble

A 2D two player throwing game. The main game idea is that there is two tanks. The two tanks will face each other in a battle throwing cannonball at each other.
You will have to hold your mouse button to set the power of your throw and release the button to throw the cannonball. If one of the tanks is hit by
one of these cannonball, the size of its health bar will be decreased and a reaction is shown on it. Also, there is a defender, who is responsible to defend the other player
by blocking the shots coming from the player. The game ends until one of them give up, which means the value of its health bar will reach to zero.
